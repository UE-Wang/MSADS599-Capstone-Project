Our dataset gives a variety of stats from NFL games over the course of 22 seasons. The data is a 998-kilobytes .csv file consisting of 5929 rows and 53 columns. Contained within the dataset are breakdowns of offensive stats categories by play type such as passing or rushing attempt. Additionally, the data is broken down by the team on offense by using the home and away teams to organize these. There are no missing or null values for any of the columns so we do not need to perform imputation to address any of them. 


## Overview:

This project aims to explore various aspects of team building and gameplay strategies in the National Football League (NFL). As the NFL continues to evolve, teams adopt different approaches to roster construction and game plans. Some teams focus on establishing a strong running game, while others prioritize passing. The hypothesis driving this project is that building a team centered around the passing game will result in greater success during the regular season. The objective is to identify the factors that have the most significant impact on winning in the NFL.By analyzing data and trends in the NFL, this project aims to assist NFL teams in better personnel and system development to enhance their chances of success. Additionally, it seeks to investigate whether there is an unfair competitive imbalance in the league that requires reform.
